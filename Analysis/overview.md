# Welcome to our visualization on the World Happiness Report!
The dataset we are working with was found on Kaggle.com, called the “World Happiness Report”. The data was collected through the Gallup World Poll. It has been collected annually since 2012, and we are using the 2015 dataset, as it has the most data available.
This report has gained attention from experts in various fields across the world. It can be of interest to economists, psychologists, policymakers, and more. This data and the analyzation of it could have a major effect on the prioritization of certain issues in a country by their leaders.
